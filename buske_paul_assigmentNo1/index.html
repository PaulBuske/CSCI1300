<h2>Career</h2>
	<p>&#129686 I have been with the United States Army for sixteen and half
	   years. I am a 25H Network Communications Specialist. I am currently
	   serving with the Army Software Factory (ASWF) in Austin, TX as a full
	   stack developer. We provide custom applications to solve Soldier
	   submitted problems. I have been with the ASWF for one and half years.
	   The first six months were in a Tech Accelerator provided by
	   Galvanize/VMware. I have been on the development floor for the past
	   year. I know HTML5, CSS, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Docker,
	   and SQL. I practice agile and lean practices associated with Extreme
	   Programming.  Prior to the factory I served for fifteen years
	   providing telecommunications solutions. &#129489;&#8205;&#128187</p>
<h2><i>Family</i></h2>
    <p>&#128112;&#127995 I married my wife Kirstie in August of this year. We
       have four dogs and one cat between the two of us! We are expecting our
       first child in July. I have a younger brother and an older sister. My
       father is deceased and I live in the same city as my mother. I was
       born in Dallas and raised in Houston. &#129328</p>
<h2><i>Hobbies</i></h2>
    <p>&#127918 I have been a gamer since Super Mario 2 on the original
       Nintendo. I spend my free time playing real time strategy games on my
       PC. I enjoy staying current on tech news, technology, geopolitics. I
       also fancy myself a whiskey and tequila connoisseur. &#128377;

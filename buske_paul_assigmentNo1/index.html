<h2>My favorite quote:</h2>

            of confidence.” - Charles Bukowski</b>

    <i>Career</i>
</h2>
<p>I have been with the United States Army for sixteen and half years. I am a 25H Network Communications Specialist.
    I am currently serving with the Army Software Factory (ASWF) in Austin, TX as a full stack developer. We provide
    custom applications to solve Soldier submitted problems. I have been with the ASWF for one and half years. The first
    six months were in a Tech Accelerator provided by Galvanize/VMware. I have been on the development floor for the
    past year. I know HTML5, CSS, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Docker, and SQL. I practice agile and lean
    practices associated with Extreme Programming.  Prior to the factory I served for fifteen years providing
    telecommunications solutions.</p>
<h2>
    <i>Family</i>
</h2>
    <p>I married my third wife Kirstie in August of this year. I am expecting my first child with her in July. I have
        a younger brother and an older sister. My father is deceased and I live in the same city as my mother.
        I was born in Dallas and raised in Houston. </p>
<h2>
    <i>Hobbies</i>
</h2>
    <p>I have been a gamer since Super Mario 2 on the original Nintendo. I spend my free time playing real time
        strategy games on my PC. I enjoy staying current on tech news, technology, geopolitics.
        I also fancy myself a whiskey and tequila connoisseur. </p>

	<p>&emsp; I experienced a collage of cultures just from walking around the
	   city. All the different customs contrast against the overall
	   lifestyle of what it is to be a "New Yorker". All five senses were
	   uniquely bombarded as we transitioned between boroughs. I found it
	   fascinating.
		<br><br> &emsp; It was a humbling and somber experience to visit ground
	   zero six months after the events of 9/11. We were there to visit my
	   sister who was late to work at the trade towers that day. There were
	   signs of the missing, U.S. flags signed by supportive citizens from
	   all over the United States, and recover crews going to and from their
	   shifts. I spoke with a junior captain from one of the fire crews that
	   were lost in the towers. He said that he took shifts helping with
	   clean up on his days off from the fire department. His demonstrated
	   love for his fellow man and city were above reproach. I remember
	   returning to her apartment in New Jersey and watching the spotlights
	   light up for the first time to represent where the towers used to be.
	   The whole the experience influenced my decision to join the Army after
	   high school.</p>
